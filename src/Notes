Java does not allow polyextension (c extends b and a )
but c can extend b which extends a


Exceptions
    NullPointer
        points to null
    ClassCast
        Cast is not allowed - casting across not allowed / down the tree
    compile can A a be of B()?
    yes
    runtime
    can b() be of type d()

      A
     B C
    D

    ^
    ^Compile looks up and down tree
    Runtime goes up only

    A a = new D()
    ok ok.
    can cast below var type not object type
